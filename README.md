The SystemVerilog Projects and files in this repository are based on the excellent text by Pong Chu FPGA Prototyping by SystemVerilog Examples (Xilinx MicroBlaze MCS SoC Edition). 

The projects in this Repository were implemented on the ”Nexys A7-100T” FPGA trainer board by DIGILENT (previously known as the Nexys 4 DDR).
